⁍ News (Mar 2022): Lim's paper, [Stochastic Integral representation of solutions to the Hodge theoretic Poisson's equations on Graphs, and value allocation theory of Shapley and Nash](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/PoissonHodgegraph.pdf), has now combined Lim's preceding articles [A Hodge theoretic extension of Shapley axioms](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/ShapleyAxioms.pdf) and  [Hodge theoretic reward allocation for generalized cooperative games on graphs](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/ShapleyGeneralGraph.pdf).

⁍ News (Feb 2022): Lim's paper, [On the cardinality of sets in R^d obeying a slightly obtuse angle bound](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.13871.pdf), will be published in [SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics](https://www.siam.org/publications/journals/siam-journal-on-discrete-mathematics-sidma). This is joint work with [Robert J. McCann](http://www.math.toronto.edu/mccann/).

⁍ News (Jan 2022): Lim's paper, [Maximizing expected powers of the angle between pairs of points in projective space](https://rdcu.be/cFHnR), has been published online in [Probability Theory and Related Fields](https://www.springer.com/journal/440). This is joint work with [Robert J. McCann](http://www.math.toronto.edu/mccann/).

⁍ News (Sep 2021): Lim's new papers, [Classifying minimum energy states for interacting particles -- Spherical shells](http://www.math.toronto.edu/mccann/papers/SphericalShell.pdf), and [Classifying minimum energy states for interacting particles -- Regular simplices](http://www.math.toronto.edu/mccann/papers/Simplices.pdf), have now appeared. These are joint work with [Robert J. McCann](http://www.math.toronto.edu/mccann/) and his student Cameron Davis. The papers study the interaction energy minimization problem in which the energy is governed by a power-law, borderline mildly-repulsive potential. We provide a complete characterization of the minimizers for this critical regime and beyond.

⁍ News (Jul 2021): Lim's new papers, [A Hodge theoretic extension of Shapley axioms](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/ShapleyAxioms.pdf) and  [Hodge theoretic reward allocation for generalized cooperative games on graphs](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/ShapleyGeneralGraph.pdf), have now appeared. The paper proposes a new extension of Shapley's celebrated axioms for cooperative games in light of Hodge decomposition, and realize them through an intriguing stochastic path integral driven by a canonical, time-reversible Markov chain. This paper was inspired by the nice work of [A. Stern and A. Tettenhorst](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08318).
