News (06/29/21): A new paper [A Hodge theoretic extension of Shapley axioms](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/Shapleyaxioms.pdf) will appear soon in arXiv and SSRN. This paper proposes a new extension of Shapley's celebrated axioms for cooperative games. The paper has been strongly inspired by the work of [A. Stern and A. Tettenhorst](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08318).
