⁍ News (06/29/21, 07/22/21): Lim's new papers, [A Hodge theoretic extension of Shapley axioms](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/ShapleyAxioms.pdf), and [Hodge theoretic reward allocation for generalized cooperative games on graphs](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/ShapleyGeneralGraph.pdf), have now appeared. The papers propose a new extension of Shapley's celebrated axioms for cooperative games in light of Hodge decomposition, and realize them through an intriguing stochastic path integral driven by a canonical, time-reversible Markov chain. The papers were inspired by the nice work of [A. Stern and A. Tettenhorst](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08318).
