· News (06/29/21): Lim's new paper ["A Hodge theoretic extension of Shapley axioms"](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/ShapleyAxioms.pdf) has appeared. This paper proposes a new extension of Shapley's celebrated axioms for cooperative games, and realize them through an interesting stochastic path integral powered by a canonical Markov chain. The paper was inspired by the nice work of [A. Stern and A. Tettenhorst](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08318).
