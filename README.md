⁍ News (Dec 2021): Lim's paper, [Maximizing expected powers of the angle between pairs of points in projective space](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/Toth_second.pdf), will appear in [Probability Theory and Related Fields](https://www.springer.com/journal/440). This is joint work with [Robert J. McCann](http://www.math.toronto.edu/mccann/).

⁍ News (Sep 2021): Lim's new papers, [Classifying minimum energy states for interacting particles (I) -- Spherical shells](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/SphericalShell.pdf), and [Classifying minimum energy states for interacting particles (II) -- Regular simplices](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/Simplex.pdf), have now appeared. These are joint work with [Robert J. McCann](http://www.math.toronto.edu/mccann/) and his student Cameron Davis. The papers study the interaction energy minimization problem in which the energy is governed by a power-law, borderline mildly-repulsive potential. We provide a complete characterization of the minimizers for this critical regime and beyond.

⁍ News (Jul 2021): Lim's new papers, [A Hodge theoretic extension of Shapley axioms](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/ShapleyAxioms.pdf), and [Hodge theoretic reward allocation for generalized cooperative games on graphs](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/ShapleyGeneralGraph.pdf), have now appeared. The papers propose a new extension of Shapley's celebrated axioms for cooperative games in light of Hodge decomposition, and realize them through an intriguing stochastic path integral driven by a canonical, time-reversible Markov chain. The papers were inspired by the nice work of [A. Stern and A. Tettenhorst](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08318).
