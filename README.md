⁍ News (06/29/21): Lim's new paper ["A Hodge theoretic extension of Shapley axioms"](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3876004) has now appeared. This paper proposes a new extension of Shapley's celebrated axioms for cooperative games, and realize them through an intriguing stochastic path integral driven by a canonical Markov chain. The paper was inspired by the nice work of [A. Stern and A. Tettenhorst](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08318).
