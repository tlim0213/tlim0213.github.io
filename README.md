⁍ News (May 2022): Lim's paper, [Maximal monotonicity and cyclic involutivity of multi-conjugate convex functions](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/MMconvexanalysis2.pdf), will be published in [SIAM Journal on Optimization](https://www.siam.org/publications/journals/siam-journal-on-optimization-siopt).

⁍ News (Mar 2022): Lim's paper, [Geometry of vectorial martingale optimal transportations and duality](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/VMOT.pdf), will be published in [Mathematical Programming](https://www.springer.com/journal/10107) series A. The paper investigates duality and its strong attainment of the martingale optimal transport problem given vectorial marginal distributions, which is motivated by robust mathematical finance.

⁍ News (Feb 2023): Lim's paper, announced in Mar 2022, has been completely rewritten with new results and a new title: [Hodge allocation for cooperative rewards: a generalization of Shapley's cooperative value allocation theory via Hodge theory on graphs](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/GeneralShapleyTheory.pdf).

⁍ News (Dec 2022): Lim's paper, announced in July 2022, has been significantly expanded from the previous version, and bears a new title: [Maximal monotonicity and cyclic involutivity of multi-conjugate convex functions](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/MMconvexanalysis2.pdf).

⁍ News (Nov 2022): Lim's paper, [Classifying minimum energy states for interacting particles: Regular simplices](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/Simplex.pdf), will be published in [Communications in Mathematical Physics](https://www.springer.com/journal/220). This is joint work with [Robert J. McCann](http://www.math.toronto.edu/mccann/) and his student Cameron Davis.

⁍ News (Jul 2022): Lim's new paper, [Completeness and maximal monotonicity of multi-conjugate convex functions on the line](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/MMconvexanalysis.pdf), has now appeared. The paper introduces the notion of generalized involution of several convex functions which we call completeness of convex conjugation, and studies its validity and connection with maximal monotonicity induced by multi-conjugate convex functions.

⁍ News (May 2022): Lim's paper, [Classifying minimum energy states for interacting particles: Spherical shells](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.11718.pdf), will be published in [SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics](https://www.siam.org/publications/journals/siam-journal-on-applied-mathematics-siap). This is joint work with [Robert J. McCann](http://www.math.toronto.edu/mccann/) and his student Cameron Davis.

⁍ News (Mar 2022): Lim's presentation was given at the BIRS workshop [Video](http://www.birs.ca/events/2022/5-day-workshops/22w5166/videos/watch/202203211443-Lim.html), explaining the paper [Stochastic integral representation of solutions to Hodge theoretic Poisson's equations on graphs, and cooperative value allocation of Shapley and Nash](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/PoissonHodgegraph.pdf). I hope you enjoy it! The paper combines Lim's preceding articles in the News (Jul 2021).

⁍ News (Feb 2022): Lim's paper, [On the cardinality of sets in R^d obeying a slightly obtuse angle bound](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.13871.pdf), will be published in [SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics](https://www.siam.org/publications/journals/siam-journal-on-discrete-mathematics-sidma). This is joint work with [Robert J. McCann](http://www.math.toronto.edu/mccann/).

⁍ News (Jan 2022): Lim's paper, [Maximizing expected powers of the angle between pairs of points in projective space](https://rdcu.be/cFHnR), has been published online in [Probability Theory and Related Fields](https://www.springer.com/journal/440). This is joint work with [Robert J. McCann](http://www.math.toronto.edu/mccann/).

⁍ News (Sep 2021): Lim's new papers, [Classifying minimum energy states for interacting particles: Spherical Shells](http://www.math.toronto.edu/mccann/papers/SphericalShell.pdf), and [Classifying minimum energy states for interacting particles: Regular Simplices](http://www.math.toronto.edu/mccann/papers/Simplices.pdf), have now appeared. These are joint work with [Robert J. McCann](http://www.math.toronto.edu/mccann/) and his student Cameron Davis. The papers study the interaction energy minimization problem in which the energy is governed by a power-law, borderline mildly-repulsive potential. We provide a complete characterization of the minimizers for this critical regime and beyond.

⁍ News (Jul 2021): Lim's new papers, [A Hodge theoretic extension of Shapley axioms](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/ShapleyAxioms.pdf) and  [Hodge theoretic reward allocation for generalized cooperative games on graphs](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/ShapleyGeneralGraph.pdf), have now appeared. The paper proposes a new extension of Shapley's celebrated axioms for cooperative games in light of Hodge decomposition, and realize them through an intriguing stochastic path integral driven by a canonical, time-reversible Markov chain. This paper was inspired by the nice work of [A. Stern and A. Tettenhorst](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08318).
