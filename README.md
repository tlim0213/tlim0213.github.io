⁍ News (Sep 2025): Lim's paper, *[Node Classification via Simplicial Interaction with Augmented Maximal Clique Selection](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/MaximalClique.pdf)*, has been accepted for publication in the *[Neurocomputing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/neurocomputing)*.
In this paper, we introduce our augmented maximal clique strategy to address key challenges in higher-order node classification. We recognized that while using all network cliques for learning is computationally prohibitive, relying solely on maximal cliques creates a "frequency imbalance" that overrepresents certain nodes in the training process. Our main contribution is a method that resolves this trade-off: we start with the efficient foundation of maximal cliques and then strategically reintroduce select non-maximal cliques specifically to ensure a more balanced and effective training process across the entire network. To validate our strategy, we provide a theoretical analysis to quantify its computational advantages and present extensive empirical results showing its superior performance, and we also demonstrate how it can be integrated with Graph Neural Networks to achieve even greater accuracy.

⁍ News (Feb 2025): Lim's new paper, *[Robust Intervention in Networks](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/Robust_Intervention_in_Networks.pdf)*, has now appeared. In various contexts, such as learning, social distancing behavior, and financial contagion, economic agents' influences are interdependent and can be represented as a network. This paper investigates how a decision maker (DM) can design an optimal intervention while addressing uncertainty in the network structure. The DM's problem is modeled as a zero-sum game against an adversarial player, referred to as ``Nature,'' whose objective is to disrupt the DM’s goals by reconfiguring the network into its most disadvantageous state. Using the principle of duality, we derive the DM's unique robust intervention strategy and identify the corresponding unique worst-case network structure determined by Nature. This framework provides insights into robust decision-making under network uncertainty, balancing the DM's objectives with Nature’s adversarial actions.

⁍ News (Feb 2025): Lim's new paper, *[Data denoising with self consistency, variance maximization, and the Kantorovich dominance](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/KantorovichOrder.pdf)*, has now appeared. This paper presents a novel data denoising framework inspired by martingale optimal transport, aimed at identifying the closest distribution to noisy data while enforcing a prescribed structural constraint and self-consistency. The framework is connected to existing denoising approaches, with proofs establishing key properties such as solution existence and robustness. Furthermore, the paper introduces Kantorovich dominance, a new distributional dominance relationship, and utilizes it to formulate a modified denoising problem that enhances stability, improves computational efficiency, and yields more meaningful solutions in certain domains. This is joint work with Joshua Hiew, [Brendan Pass](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~pass/) and Marcelo Souza.

⁍ News (Jan 2025): Lim's new paper, *[Monotone Curve Estimation via Convex Duality](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/MonotoneCurve.pdf)*, has now appeared. This paper presents a novel monotone principal curve framework based on optimal transport theory, offering a smooth and continuous 1-dimensional representation of data. We establish statistical guarantees for the monotone curve estimate, such as expected empirical and generalized mean squared errors. These foundations support the use of early stopping procedures in machine learning for efficient implementation with neural networks. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms competing approaches in accuracy for data with monotonic structures.

⁍ News (Dec 2024): Lim's paper, *[Node Classification in Networks via Simplicial Interactions](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/NodeClassification.pdf)*, has been accepted for publication in the *[IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843167)*. The paper proposes a probability-based objective function for semi-supervised network node classification that takes advantage of higher-order networks’ capabilities. We evaluate the function using both balanced and imbalanced datasets generated by the novel Stochastic Block Tensor Model (SBTM), as well as a real-world citation datasets. According to the results, in challenging classification contexts, higher-order networks outperform pairwise interactions in terms of objective function performance.

⁍ News (Nov 2023): Lim's new paper, *[Optimal exercise decision of American options under model uncertainty](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/Opt.Stop.MOT.pdf)*, has now appeared. When the model uncertainty consistent with the given marginal distribution information is described as the martingale optimal transport problem, the paper shows that any option exercise scheme associated with any market model that jointly maximizes the expected option payoff must be nonrandomized if the American option payoff satisfies a suitable convexity condition and the model-free price upper bound and its relaxed version coincide. The latter condition is desired to be removed under appropriate conditions on the cost and marginals.

⁍ News (Sep 2023): Lim's new paper, *[Geometry of vectorial martingale optimal transport and robust option pricing](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/VMOT_and_robust_option_pricing.pdf)*, has now appeared. The paper investigates the Vectorial Martingale Optimal Transport (VMOT) problem, the geometry of its solutions, and its application with robust option pricing problems in finance. The findings demonstrate a subtle relationship between spatial dimension, cost function supermodularity, and their effect on the geometry of solutions to the VMOT problem. Applications of the model to financial problems demonstrate how the dimensional reduction caused by monotonicity can be used to improve existing computational methods. This is joint work with [Brendan Pass](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~pass/) and two PhD students we jointly supervise: Joshua Hiew and Marcelo Souza. 

⁍ News (Jul 2023): Lim's new paper, *[Replication of financial derivatives under extreme market models given marginals](https://tlim0213.github.io/folder/papers/multiperiodVMOT.pdf)*, has now appeared. The paper shows that a portfolio sub- or super-hedging a general path-dependent derivative security in terms of trading European options and underlyings exists, and furthermore, the portfolio replicates the derivative payoff when the market model yields the extremal price of the derivative given marginal distributions of the underlyings. Mathematically, the paper establishes dual attainment for the multi-period vectorial martingale optimal transport problem.
