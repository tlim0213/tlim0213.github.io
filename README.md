News (06/29/21): Lim's new paper ["A Hodge theoretic extension of Shapley axioms"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.15094.pdf) has appeared. This paper proposes a new extension of Shapley's celebrated axioms for cooperative games. The paper was inspired by the nice work of [A. Stern and A. Tettenhorst](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08318).
